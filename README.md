# Polish SME Dataset for RAG Evaluation

A synthetic **Polish-language** dataset of business documents from a fictional marketing agency. Designed for testing and evaluating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

> **Language:** All documents are in Polish (polski). This is one of few high-quality Polish-language datasets available for RAG evaluation.

## Overview

The dataset mimics internal documents of Kreatywna Fala Sp. z o.o., a small marketing agency in Wrocław, Poland. Documents span June 2023 - July 2024 and include realistic business scenarios: client negotiations, project crises, team communications, financial reports.

### Key Features

- **100 documents** across 7 types (emails, reports, spreadsheets, presentations, meeting notes)
- **Polish business language** with authentic terminology and conventions
- **22 planted facts** with ground truth for quantitative evaluation
- **43 evaluation questions** (35 standard + 8 meta-questions for synthesizable facts)
- **Interconnected narratives** testing multi-document reasoning

## Installation

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sme-synth-data-gen.git
cd sme-synth-data-gen

# Install dependencies (optional - only needed for file generation)
uv sync --extra files
```

## Usage

### Reading the Dataset

The core dataset is in `dataset/documents.json` - no dependencies required:

```python
import json

with open('dataset/documents.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

for doc in data['documents']:
    print(f"{doc['id']}: {doc['type']} - {doc.get('title') or doc.get('subject')}")
```

### Generating Actual Files

To create .eml, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx files from the JSON:

```bash
# Install file generation dependencies
uv sync --extra files

# Generate files to output/ directory
uv run generate

# Or specify custom output directory
uv run generate --output-dir my_output/
```

### Running Tests

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest
```
