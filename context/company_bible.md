- Sales optimism vs. delivery realism

---

## Notes for Generation

- Use realistic timestamps within June 2023 - May 2024 range
- Maintain consistency: if someone is on holiday, they shouldn't send emails
- Email threads should reference previous messages realistically
- Include some mundane content (meeting confirmations, out-of-office notices) for realism
- Plant facts should appear naturally in context, not artificially highlighted
- Some documents should reference other documents (e.g., "as discussed in the October proposal...")
- Include realistic Polish addresses, NIP numbers, phone numbers
- Financial figures should be consistent across documents
- Client satisfaction and relationship status should evolve logically over time
